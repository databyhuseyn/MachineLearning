# Traditional Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

Welcome to the Traditional Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning models and techniques implemented using the Scikit-Learn library, one of the most powerful and user-friendly libraries for machine learning in Python.

# Overview
This repository showcases various traditional machine learning algorithms, providing a comprehensive guide for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to understand, implement, and optimize these models. The examples included cover the entire pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

# Features
• Data Preprocessing: Techniques for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and data splitting.
• Model Implementation: Implementation of popular traditional machine learning models, including but not limited to:
• Linear Regression
• Logistic Regression
• Decision Trees
• Random Forests
• Support Vector Machines (SVM)
• k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
• Naive Bayes
• Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
• k-Means Clustering
• Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
• Model Evaluation: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and cross-validation techniques.
• Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search, random search, and other techniques for optimizing model performance.
• Pipeline Construction: Building and managing pipelines to streamline the machine learning workflow.
